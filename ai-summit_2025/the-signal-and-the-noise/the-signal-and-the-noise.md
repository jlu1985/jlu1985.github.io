- Chief Technology Office - City of Seattle

Seattle does not have commerical and startup culture

## Where is Seattle?

Seattle is a major city in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, located in Washington State. Home to approximately 750,000 residents (3.9 million in the metro area), it's known for:

- Major tech companies (Microsoft, Amazon, Boeing)
- Progressive governance and innovation
- Diverse urban challenges: homelessness, public safety, infrastructure
- Strong commitment to data-driven decision making

## Difference Ways to deploy AI in Government

- 2017 and 2018. Access some goals to use machine learning
- Cyber Security

First year make small bets.
- Costs per token is going down

## What is a token in AI?

A token is the basic unit of text that AI language models process. Tokens can be:

- Words (e.g., "government" = 1 token)
- Parts of words (e.g., "unbelievable" = 3 tokens: "un", "believ", "able")
- Punctuation marks
- Spaces

**Why tokens matter for government AI deployment:**
- AI services are priced per token (input + output)
- 1 token ≈ 4 characters or ≈ 0.75 words in English
- As token costs decrease, AI becomes more accessible for public sector applications
- Understanding token usage helps budget and optimize AI solutions


## Single Deportament. Now it is multiple departments.

## How you are thinking grows

Recent 10 years compare all states
3 to 10 x increased Security incidents

## We can have natural disasters

Make sure People have access to information and communicate.

Wifi Networks are up

Public safety first

## Speed in recovery disaters

How to use AI to help with crisis detection and rapid response?

Talk to each other. Can you do the work that you need to do?

Create the application and engage the community.

What took weeks and months can it be done in days?

## AI
Can run 10,000 simulations. In the immegnecy, how it connect.

## People

How are you egaging the residents?

- Fire department, very earlier adapters. Language Translations and models. Reacts to the care givers.

Lots of people are binary, either good or bad.

## AI Incubator

AI House: Performance Team

## Learning Impact

Low Learn and High Impact

## How do we better prepare ourselves for the next crisis?
