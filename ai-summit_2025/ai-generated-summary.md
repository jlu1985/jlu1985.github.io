# AI Summit (Dec 2025) — Workspace Summary

## Session Highlights
- **AI in the Hot Zone: Securing Critical Infrastructure** — Deepfakes and AI-crafted phishing are overwhelming banks; CISOs need new safeguards, continuous detection, and tighter sector-specific regulation. Overview: Securing regulated critical infrastructure against AI-accelerated fraud and detection gaps.
- **AI Security Maturity Model (AISMM)** — Five-level Zero Trust-inspired ladder (identity → devices → network → apps → data); focuses on security for/from/with AI, not posture or governance frameworks. Overview: Prescriptive AI security progression aligned to zero-trust pillars.
- **AI vs. AI: Cyber Arms Race** — Email threats evolved from spray-and-pray to effortless, highly personalized AI attacks; malicious GPTs automate phishing at scale. Overview: Offensive AI supercharges social engineering, demanding AI-grade defenses.
- **Breach Workshop** — Referenced printouts; content not captured in notes. Overview: Breach response exercises (details pending from printouts).
- **Building the AI Security Workforce** — AI can triage alert overload and reduce burnout; avoid “sprinkle AI” hype; emphasize guided analyst workflows, token-cost awareness, and upskill/reskill/cross-skill paths (RAG, MCP, governance). Overview: Shift to AI-augmented analysts with deliberate skills strategy and cost literacy.
- **Enterprise Agent Factory (Google)** — Agentic era architecture: action/context/trust layers on Google Cloud; BigQuery as unified data plane; MCP/agent toolkit for governed multi-agent systems. Overview: Platform approach to build governed, context-rich agents on cloud data foundations.
- **Building the AI Factory** — Enterprises need an AI “factory” (community of builders, accelerating governance, cheap experimentation infrastructure) rather than isolated pilots; MLOps is the factory floor. Overview: Turn pilots into production via culture, guardrails, and shared infra.
- **Enterprise AI Fabric (IBM)** — Core problem is interaction and interoperability: agents need consistent tool/event/flow/policy layers; MCP/A2A positioned as “USB of the enterprise”; guardrails and gateways for safe agent-to-agent/tool access. Overview: Standardize agent interactions to scale safely across hybrid estates.
- **Human vs. Machine (Facial Recognition)** — Surveillance growth turns faces into immutable “passwords”; risks of misidentification, hiring bias, mood surveillance; calls for changing rules and code. Overview: Societal risk of pervasive facial recognition and the need for policy/tech safeguards.
- **Production-Ready GenAI (Bloomberg)** — RAG favored over fine-tuning for freshness; prompts should live in registries, not code; guardrails must check safety and relevance before user delivery. Overview: Shipping LLM apps demands RAG pipelines, prompt governance, and dual safety/relevance guardrails.
- **Neurosymbolic Decision Systems (UIUC)** — Proposes multi-agent neurosymbolic stack (planner, OR validator, policy auditor, monitors) to move from accurate predictions to safe, auditable decisions in regulated domains. Overview: Combine neural creativity with symbolic/OR constraints for responsible autonomy.
- **Product Matching (Staples)** — Multi-stage retrieval/ranking with query understanding and contrastive embeddings to beat keyword/rules approaches; highlights failure modes of legacy search. Overview: Domain-tuned retrieval plus contrastive ranking to raise precision/recall in product search.
- **Signal and the Noise (City of Seattle)** — Government AI use grows across departments; token costs falling; focus on crisis detection/response, multilingual services, and community engagement. Overview: Municipal AI playbook for resilience and inclusive services as costs drop.
- **Transforming Data Centers into AI Factories (NVIDIA/HPE)** — Enterprises retool data centers into AI factories turning data/electricity into “tokens”; heavy AI/agent workloads expected. Overview: Modernize data centers for AI/agent throughput and energy-to-model conversion.
- **AI-Powered Support (Walmart)** — Building a semantic layer to turn unstructured support data into actionable responses. Overview: Semantic enrichment to automate support actions from messy inputs.
- **Synthetic Data Sharing (JPMorgan)** — Motivations (privacy, cost, labeling); six-level maturity from PII masking to calibrated/uncalibrated simulations; surveys GAN/VAE/flow/diffusion/LLM approaches and evaluation metrics (KS, chi-squared, MMD, correlation, TSTR). Overview: Framework for privacy-preserving synthetic data with graduated fidelity and evaluation.

## Cross-Cutting Themes
- Governance and interoperability (MCP, registries, gateways) are as critical as models for scaling safely.
- Guardrails must cover both safety and relevance to prevent plausible but harmful outputs.
- Workforce strategy shifts to AI-assisted analysts with structured upskilling and token-cost literacy.
- Data quality and context layers (semantic, vector, unified data planes) underpin trustworthy agent behavior.
