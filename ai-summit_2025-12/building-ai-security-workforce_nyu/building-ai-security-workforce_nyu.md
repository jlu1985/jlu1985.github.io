Building the AI Security Workforce: From Skills Gap to Strategic Advantage

## The Good of AI in Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity pros face a deludge of threat data; AI can filter and prioritize this to manageable levels

### Information Overload

### 24/7 Defense Needs

### Talent Gap & Burnout

### Rising Attack Volume

### Empowering Analysts

### Complex Integration Challenges

## If it works, don't touch it

## The Bad

Sprinkle a little AI on it

To DO What?

- SOar 2.0
- Data co-pilot
- Detection engineering
- answer Third party risk reviews
- Automation for the sak of Automation

### What is LLM?

An LLM (Large Language Model) is a deep learning model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human language. LLMs like GPT and Claude can perform a wide range of tasks including text analysis, summarization, question-answering, and code generation. In cybersecurity, LLMs can be used to analyze threat intelligence, automate incident response, and assist analysts in processing large volumes of security data.

### Tokens everywhere

Beware of the AI Pricing Model with tokens
- Similar to API calls
- Transperancy Challenges

## AI as a Guide, Not a Guard

- Understanding Generative AI
- GPT & LLMs
  - These modles analyze and generate text, aiding in threat detection and alerts
- AI as an informative ally
- Analyst -> Investigator -> AI Supervisor
- Purpose: Democratize your cybersecurity tools
- Rapid Analysis
- Data-driven
- Integration and Scale without more headcount

### GPT vs LLM

```
LLM (Large Language Model) is a broad category of deep learning models trained on large text datasets to understand and generate language. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a specific type of LLM developed by OpenAI. All GPTs are LLMs, but not all LLMs are GPTs. Other examples of LLMs include Claude, Gemini, and Llama. In cybersecurity contexts, the distinction matters less than understanding that these models can assist with threat analysis, alert prioritization, and incident investigation.

## The Blueprints for building the AI workforce


## What do I need AI skills in Cybersecurity?


### Upskill
- New Techniques
- RAG + MCP + Agentic
- New evoling modles
- Experiment with frontier + open source models

### Reskill
- Compliance analyst into AI governance
- SOC analysts with co-intelligences
- Context is KING

#### What is SOC

A SOC (Security Operations Center) is a centralized unit responsible for monitoring, detecting, and responding to security incidents within an organization. SOC teams use security tools and intelligence to analyze threats, investigate alerts, and coordinate incident response. In the context of AI workforce development, SOCs are key environments where AI and LLMs can augment analyst capabilities through co-intelligence, automating alert triage and threat analysis while analysts focus on strategic decision-making.

### Cross-skill
- Democratize your data across cyber silos
- Help Desk + IT + Dev + infra + *
- Data Scientist + Domain Expertise
- Frontier Models scan all the data but are not domain experts

# What is KPI?

```
A KPI (Key Performance Indicator) is a measurable value that shows how effectively something is achieving business objectives. In the context of AI security workforce development, relevant KPIs might include: analyst productivity improvements, mean time to detect (MTTD) reduction, alert fatigue decrease, incident resolution speed, and employee retention rates. KPIs help organizations track whether AI implementations are delivering strategic value beyond pilot programs.
