Redefining Enterprise Decision Systems : Engineering Neurosymbolic Agents for Responsible Autonomy

## What is Neurosymbolic AI?


Agenda

## Definition What is a Neurosymbolic Agent?

A unified framework where continuous neural network"

## The Problem

- Enterprise AI predicts well but decides poorly, because prediction ~= decision
- LLM-driven systems hallucinate and can't guarantee safety, especially in regulated industries.
- OR systems offer guarantees but lack adaptability, making them brittle in dynamic environments.

## Why this matters now

- Regulated domains face rising pressure for fairness, safety

Opacity tolerated (2015). => Opacity unacceptable (2025)
Compliance bar rises => Regulatory load increases

## The Core Proposition

Neurosymbolic, Multi-Agent Decision Systems

## Architectural Preview

A multi-agent ecosystem with distinct roles:

- Generative Planner Agent: Explores strategies
- OR Constraint-solving agent: validates each plan against opeartional and resource constraints
- Policy-Auditor Agent: enforces regulations, fairness criteria, and compliance rules
- Monitoring & Alignment Agents: detect drift anomalies, and adversarial


## The Missing Piece: Competition for Alignment

- Neural agents generate creative but noisy hypotheses. missing edge cases or misaligned ideas
- Symoblic and OR agents serve as challenger: rejecting unsafe, infeasible, or non-compliant proposals
- Competition drives convergence toward safer, more aligned decisions: mimicking human oversight loops
- Inspired by the research of "Emergent Alignment via Competition" and C3AN's alignment pillars

## Why Neurosymbolic Competition Works

## Industry Case 3: Manufacturing

## Responsible Autonomy Through Constraints

- Governance rules become first-class constraints

## Explainability & Auditablity Built In

- Machine-readable explanations for why a plan was accepted or rejected.
- Constraints

## Extending Competition with Neurosymbolic Agents

## Frontier Research Questions

- Preference Drift
- Multi-Human Alignment
- Collusion Resistance
- Balancing Rigor & Laency
