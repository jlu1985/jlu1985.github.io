- What are predicted chun chores (2010 ~ 2020)
- agentic era


## Agents will be engated in every area

- customer agents
- creative agents

### What is MCP?

MCP, or **Model Context Protocol**, is a framework designed to enable an AI model or agent to interact with a set of external, versioned "tools" in a structured, scalable, and governed manner.

- **Extending Capabilities**: It allows the AI to perform actions beyond its inherent knowledge, such as fetching live data (e.g., `get_metrics`), interacting with cloud services (e.g., `get_lambda_guidance`), or accessing specific databases.
- **Structured Interaction**: The protocol defines a clear, versioned contract for how the AI communicates with tools, ensuring reliability and managing changes over time.
- **Governance**: By centralizing tool access through a protocol, it provides a control plane for security, monitoring, and managing how the AI is allowed to interact with external systems.

## BigQuery

### What is BigQuery
Google BigQuery is a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse that enables super-fast SQL queries on massive datasets. As part of Google's Data Cloud, it serves as a scalable and secure foundation for storing and analyzing the data that AI agents use. Its key features include a serverless architecture (no infrastructure to manage), separation of storage and compute for cost-effective scaling, real-time analytics capabilities, and built-in machine learning (BigQuery ML), which allows creating ML models directly with SQL. In the context of an "Enterprise Agent Factory," BigQuery acts as the unified data plane, providing the trusted, large-scale context that agents need to reason and act effectively.
