AI in the Hot Zone: Securing Critical Infrastructure Across Regulated Sectors

## Panel Overview

- AI Risk
- Regulation & Compliance

### CISO

Chief Information Security Officer—responsible for an organization's information security strategy, risk management, and compliance with security policies and regulations.

## Deep Fakes Hitting Banks

- Deepfake frauds as AI become better and stronger
- Business Leaders are pushing deploying AI

## Dive Deeper into Cyber Security

- Phishing Trainings. Easy to detect. Human cannot pickup AI crafted phishing emails.
- Speed and acturacy of AI generated attacks.

## Model Risks
Data Science, prediction and big data

### Is Big Data no longer relevant?

Big Data refers to extremely large datasets that are too complex for traditional data processing tools. It involves:
- **Volume**: Massive amounts of data collected from multiple sources
- **Velocity**: Fast generation and processing of data in real-time
- **Variety**: Diverse data types (structured, unstructured, semi-structured)

In regulated sectors, Big Data remains critical for detecting anomalies, identifying fraud patterns, and enabling predictive security measures—but now it must be processed with strict privacy and compliance controls.


Models Risks, are very hard to explainable.

Predication Mdoel Crash pre AI era.

### How do we put safeguards?

CISO sides, how to we do things carefully. Threats, vulnerabilities, risks. What happens when AI makes decisions at scale without human oversight?

Whats challenging is AI has access to all kinds of data.

As a CISO, we may not be able to get it right, but can we build systems that can detect when things go wrong?

Phishing is Phishing regardless how well it is wrtten.

We cannot respond to an incident the same way we did before AI.

Reevaluate controls, policies, and procedures.

## Responsibility, Risks and Regulations

Regulartions needs to be more aggresive. 
Depends on the use case. For example, EU, social score prohibited. 

Kept the regulartion but reiterate new guidance. 
EU is Principal based, for example, do best customer outcome (Harder to measure)
